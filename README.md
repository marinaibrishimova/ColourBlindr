Colourblindr is a Javascript application that allows the user to see an approximation of
what the world looks like to people with the main different types of colour vision deficiencies.

The colour vision algorithms were originally designed as a part of Coloroid's Color Vision tools 
(https://coloroid.net) by Marina Ibrishimova of Ibrius Inc. (marina@ibrius.net)
